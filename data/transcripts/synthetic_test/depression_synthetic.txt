Therapist: Hi, welcome. It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?

Client: Uh, yeah, I guess I'm okay? I dunno, just, yeah, it's been a bit rough lately.

Therapist: I hear you. When you say rough, can you tell me a little more about what you mean?

Client: Yeah, so, it’s just been like... you know when you wake up and you just don’t really feel like... I dunno, like doing anything? Like, just getting out of bed feels like a whole thing.

Therapist: Mhm, yeah. That sounds really tough. When did you start feeling this way?

Client: I guess it’s been a few months now? Maybe since, like, November or something? It kinda just snuck up on me, I guess.

Therapist: Right, okay. And do you remember anything happening around that time? Like, any major changes or stressors?

Client: Not really? I mean, work is always kinda stressful, but not more than usual, I think? And I dunno, I guess I've just been feeling kinda empty? Like, even when I'm doing stuff I used to enjoy, it’s just kinda, nothing, you know?

Therapist: Yeah, I hear you. That feeling of emptiness, like things that used to bring joy don’t really do that anymore… That’s something that can be really difficult to sit with.

Client: Yeah, exactly. And I dunno, it’s like, I try to push through and force myself to do things but it doesn’t really work? And then I just feel worse ‘cause, like, maybe I should be trying harder or something?

Therapist: That sounds frustrating. And I want to say, you know, this isn’t about trying harder or pushing through. Depression—if that’s what’s going on here—isn’t about willpower, right? It’s a real thing that can affect so much.

Client: Yeah... I mean, I get that, but also, like, I feel like other people, they just kinda deal with stuff, right? And I just, can’t, I dunno, handle life?

Therapist: Mhm, yeah, I hear that. It sounds like maybe you’ve been feeling kind of self-critical about this?

Client: Yeah. I guess. Like, I feel like I should just be able to get over it or be normal, you know?

Therapist: Mhm. Yeah, that makes sense. And I just wanna acknowledge that it’s really hard to feel this way. But you’re not broken or failing at anything. It sounds like you’re really struggling, and that’s valid.

Client: Yeah… I guess. I dunno, I just don’t wanna feel like this forever, you know?

Therapist: Yeah, absolutely. And I wanna say that you’re not alone in this. There are ways we can work together to help you start feeling more like yourself again.

Client: Yeah? Like, how?

Therapist: Well, first, we can start by just exploring what’s been going on for you. And over time, we can look at different tools and strategies that might help, you know, kinda lighten the load a bit.

Client: Hm, yeah… I guess that sounds okay.

Therapist: Yeah. And no pressure, right? This is just a space for you to talk and be heard, however that looks for you.

Client: Yeah… yeah, okay.

Therapist: Okay, something I’m curious about—how has your sleep been? Sometimes, sleep patterns can tell us a lot about what’s going on.

Client: Uh… not great? I mean, I either can’t fall asleep or I sleep way too much. Like, I’ll just stay in bed all day sometimes ‘cause, what’s the point, y’know?

Therapist: Yeah, yeah, I get that. Sleep changes, whether it’s too much or not enough, can be a big sign that something’s weighing on you.

Client: Yeah, I guess… I just don’t feel like I get any real rest, even when I do sleep a lot.

Therapist: Right. That’s really hard. And I wanna say, it makes sense that you’re feeling exhausted if you’re carrying all this around, right?

Client: Yeah… I dunno, I just wish I had more energy. Like, even the small things feel so much bigger than they used to.

Therapist: Yeah, I hear you. That feeling of everything taking so much effort, it’s really tough.

Client: Yeah… and like, I don’t really talk to my friends as much anymore. I don’t wanna bother them, you know? Like, I should be able to deal with my own stuff.

Therapist: That makes sense, yeah. But I wanna remind you, you’re not a burden. Feeling like this doesn’t mean you have to go through it alone.

Client: I dunno. It just feels like nobody really gets it.

Therapist: I hear you. And that’s really isolating, right? But I promise, you’re not alone in this. There are people who care about you, and we can work on helping you reconnect with them in a way that feels safe for you.

Client: Yeah, maybe… I guess it’s just hard to imagine feeling better, you know?

Therapist: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. When you’ve been feeling this way for a while, it can be hard to picture things changing. But I want you to know, healing is possible.

Client: Hm. Yeah…

Therapist: And I really appreciate you sharing all of this with me today. I know it’s not easy to talk about these things.

Client: Yeah, thanks. I wasn’t really sure what to expect but, this has been… okay, I guess.

Therapist: I’m really glad to hear that. And before we wrap up today, I wanna check in—how are you feeling right now?

Client: I dunno, maybe a little lighter? Like, I got some of this out of my head, at least.

Therapist: That’s great. And I want you to know, we can keep exploring this together. If you’re open to it, I’d love to see you again next session.

Client: Yeah… yeah, I think that’d be good.

Therapist: Okay, great. So, between now and next time, I just want you to be gentle with yourself, okay? And if you notice anything coming up—thoughts, feelings, anything—just take note of it. We can talk about it next time.

Client: Yeah… okay. Thanks.

Therapist: You’re very welcome. Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
